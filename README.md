## 🔥 **BREAKTHROUGH: Heating Demand Prediction Model**

After discovering fundamental flaws in temperature prediction approaches, we achieved a **breakthrough** by switching to direct heating demand prediction. This represents the **most critical insight** of the project.

### 🎯 **Model Performance**
![Heating Demand Training Performance](reports/figures/heating_demand_training_performance.png)

**Key Metrics:**
- **Test MAE:** 2.48 degree-hours (**26% improvement** over temperature models)
- **Test RMSE:** 2.99 degree-hours (**36% improvement** over temperature models)
- **CV RMSE:** 1.12 degree-hours (robust cross-validation performance)

### 📊 **Comprehensive Model Analysis**
![Comprehensive Analysis](reports/figures/heating_demand_comprehensive_analysis.png)

**Performance Insights:**
- **Zero heating demand (summer):** 934 samples (28.8%), MAE=4.427 degree-hours
- **Non-zero heating demand:** 2,306 samples (71.2%), MAE=1.687 degree-hours
- **Seasonal patterns:** Spring: 1.41, Summer: 2.70, Autumn: 2.26 degree-hours MAE
- **R² Score:** High correlation between actual and predicted values

### 🎯 **Feature Importance Analysis**
![Feature Importance](reports/figures/heating_demand_feature_importance_professional.png)

**Top Contributing Features:**
- **Heating demand forecast:** Direct physics-based prediction from weather forecasts
- **Apparent temperature:** Current and lagged weather conditions
- **Temporal patterns:** Hour, season, and cyclical time features
- **Weather interactions:** Wind chill, solar heating effects

### 🌡️ **Temporal Performance Patterns**
![Seasonal Analysis](reports/figures/heating_demand_seasonal_analysis.png)

**Key Patterns:**
- **Hourly:** Best performance at night (1.4-1.6 MAE), higher mid-day errors (3.1-3.2)
- **Monthly:** Spring months show lowest errors, summer months show expected higher variance
- **Seasonal distribution:** Clear physical heating demand patterns across seasons

## 🔄 **MAJOR PROJECT PIVOT: From Temperature Prediction to Heating Demand**

### **The Fundamental Problem We Discovered**
After extensive experimentation with apparent temperature prediction models, we uncovered a **critical conceptual flaw** that was causing all approaches to fail:

1. **Data Distribution Catastrophe:**
   - Training set: Maximum 23.4°C (mostly cold months Oct-Apr)
   - Test set: Maximum 35.0°C (mostly warm months May-Sep)
   - **12°C extrapolation gap** - like training on bicycles, testing on airplanes

2. **Inverse Relationship Problem:**
   - **Summer:** High apparent temperature = LOW heating demand
   - **Winter:** Low apparent temperature = HIGH heating demand  
   - Predicting temperature as proxy created backwards relationships

3. **XGBoost Extrapolation Ceiling:**
   - Tree models plateau at ~15°C, couldn't learn beyond training distribution
   - All advanced techniques (monotonic constraints, sample weighting, feature engineering) failed

### **The Breakthrough Solution**
**Switch target from apparent temperature to direct heating demand prediction:**

```python
# OLD (broken): Predict temperature as proxy
target = df['apparent_temperature'].shift(-1)

# NEW (correct): Predict actual heating demand  
heating_demand = max(0, 18°C - apparent_temperature)
target = heating_demand.shift(-1)
```

### **Why This Fixed Everything**
- ✅ **Eliminates extrapolation:** Model interpolates within 0-27 degree-hours range
- ✅ **Correct physics:** Summer → 0 heating demand, Winter → positive heating demand
- ✅ **Optimisation-ready:** Direct input for heat pump controller
- ✅ **26-36% better performance:** Immediate improvement across all metrics

### **Key Learning**
> **"The target variable defines the success ceiling of any ML project. Wrong target = guaranteed failure, regardless of model sophistication."**

This pivot from temperature proxy to direct heating demand represents the **most critical insight** of the entire project and should guide all future smart building ML applications.
